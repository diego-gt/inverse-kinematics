# Inverse Kinematics

## BUILDING
You need a C++ compiler with C++20 capabilities. This is being developed on Windows with the latest Visual Studio 2022 and with Clang/CMake.

If you are using Visual Studio, you should be able to add this project to your solution and run it.

If you are using CMake, we recommend using the following for building purposes:
```sh
cloned_repo$ cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
```
